# Find My Food
This app is created as the final project for CIS 197-Javascript. 
# Motivation
There is a lot of food waste around Penn campus. Various club activities, information sessions or department events often come with a substantial
amount of leftover food. The food is then left out at some hallway on campus at random times. This app introduces the idea of creating a 
centralized platform to match unwanted food that's in perfectly fine condition to people in need. 
# Description
Logged in and authenticated users would be able to browse postings of free food, which include a time, location and description. They can also create
new postings about free food or mark a food as "gone".
